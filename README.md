# Instagram Message Formatter

This program formats downloaded Instagram message data for a specific chat. The data download request from Instagram's website will include a messages.json file.
It parses through the downloaded JSON file and creates or edits a messages.html file.  
Before running InstagramMessageParser.py, modify the USERNAME variable to store your Instagram username. Then modify the TARGET variable to store the usernames of everybody else in the chat.
